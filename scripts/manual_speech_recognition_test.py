"""Manual, interactive speech recognition check.

Displays text for you to speak, records your voice, and transcribes it
to verify the speech recognition is working. Requires a real microphone
and a running Whisper service on 127.0.0.1:8001 -- not a pytest test
(deliberately not named test_*.py / test_* function, and lives outside
tests/, so it is never collected by CI or `pytest tests`).

Run directly:
    python scripts/manual_speech_recognition_test.py
